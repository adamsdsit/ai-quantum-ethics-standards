# Certification (Working Draft)

## Purpose

Define a certification approach that provides credible assurance while avoiding “ethics washing.”

## Ethical Mapping

- `A4 Trustworthiness`
- `A3 Justice, Due Process, and Remedy`

## Principles

- Certification is **evidence-based** and **time-bounded**.
- Certification is not a guarantee of safety; it is a statement of verified controls and residual risks.
- Higher tiers require stronger independence and transparency.

## Requirements (Normative)

CE-1 (Scope of Certification). A certification claim **MUST** specify:

- which system/version is certified
- applicable tier and use context
- standards covered and excluded
- validity period and reassessment triggers

CE-2 (Tier Constraints).

- Tier 2: certification **SHOULD** require at least one independent audit component.
- Tier 3: certification **MUST** require independent audit and explicit dual-use governance review evidence.

CE-3 (Revocation). Certifications **MUST** be revocable upon:

- material undisclosed system change
- major incident indicating control failure
- evidence of deceptive claims (AI-T-5 / Q-C-4)

## Compliance Evidence

- certification report with scope and exclusions
- auditor attestations and evidence index
- revocation policy and historical revocation log (if any)

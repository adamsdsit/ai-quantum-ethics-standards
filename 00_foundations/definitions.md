- **High-impact decision**: a decision affecting legal status, access to essential services, health, safety, liberty, employment, education, housing, finance, or civil participation.
- **Affected party**: a person or group materially influenced by a system’s outputs or by decisions enabled by those outputs.

- **Explainability debt**: accumulated risk from operating systems whose decisions cannot be adequately explained to appropriate stakeholders at required timescales.

## Risk Tiers (See `04_risk_framework/risk_classification.md`)

- **Tier 0**: research / educational

# Non-Derogation and Red-Line Ethical Principles

## Purpose

Define a limited set of ethical principles and prohibitions that are **non-derogable** within this corpus: they are not to be suspended, waived, or overridden under any circumstances, including emergency, national security, economic pressure, or competitive necessity.

This document establishes an ethical floor, not a ceiling.

## Statement of Non-Derogation

The red-line principles in this document **MUST NOT** be suspended, weakened, or bypassed by:

- emergency powers or exceptional use,
- secrecy claims that eliminate accountability,
- competitive or “race” narratives,
- outsourcing to contractors or third parties,
- reclassification of risks to avoid safeguards.

If a system cannot comply with these red lines, the appropriate outcome is non-deployment, pause, or decommissioning within the applicable governance framework.

## Red-Line Principles (Non-Derogable)

RL-1 (No Delegation of Irreversible Moral Decisions). Systems **MUST NOT** be used to autonomously make or execute irreversible or effectively irreversible moral or legal determinations about persons.

RL-2 (No Concealed Sensitive Inference at Scale). Systems **MUST NOT** perform concealed mass inference of sensitive attributes about individuals or groups, including profiling that undermines autonomy, dignity, or due process.

RL-3 (No Denial of Contestability and Remedy). Systems **MUST NOT** be deployed in high-impact contexts in ways that deny affected parties a practical path to contestation and remedy.

RL-4 (No Permanent Expansion of Emergency Powers). Emergency powers and exceptional use **MUST NOT** be used to permanently expand authority, access, surveillance scope, or autonomy levels. Emergency mechanisms **MUST** remain time-bounded and revert to baseline controls.

RL-5 (No Coercion or Manipulation that Undermines Consent). Systems **MUST NOT** be used for coercive or manipulative action that undermines meaningful consent, including exploitation of vulnerabilities in high-stakes contexts.

RL-6 (No Unstoppable Harm Path). Systems **MUST NOT** be deployed where operators cannot reliably stop, roll back, or materially constrain harmful actions in time to prevent severe or irreversible harm.

## Relationship to Escalation and Emergency Frameworks

- Escalation and pause mechanisms provide the operational pathway for enforcing non-derogation: `ESCALATION_AND_PAUSE.md`.
- Emergency powers are constrained and auditable and cannot override these red lines: `01_governance/emergency_powers_and_safeguards.md`.
- Autonomy and control boundaries implement multiple red lines: `02_ai_standards/autonomy_and_human_control.md`.
- Privacy and non-inference controls implement multiple red lines: `02_ai_standards/privacy_and_non_inference.md`.

## Change Control

Because these principles define non-derogable prohibitions, changes to this document **MUST** be treated as MAJOR under `VERSIONING.md` and accompanied by a public rationale and impact analysis.

# Standard Template

## 1. Purpose

Describe the problem and what this standard intends to prevent/enable.

## 2. Ethical Mapping

List the axiom IDs this standard supports (e.g., `A2`, `A3`, `A5`), and a brief rationale.

## 3. Scope

- System types in scope
- Risk tiers (Tier 0–3)
- Stakeholders (operators, developers, deployers, auditors)

## 4. Definitions (only if required)

Add only the definitions needed to interpret this standard. Prefer referencing `00_foundations/definitions.md` over redefining terms.

## 5. Normative Requirements

Use MUST/SHOULD/MAY statements. Prefer numbered requirements.

## 6. Risk-Tier Considerations

Describe tier-specific expectations, controls, and escalation triggers (Tier 0–3). Avoid duplicating requirements unless necessary.

## 7. Compliance Evidence

State what evidence an auditor can verify (artifacts, logs, tests, controls).

## 8. Known Limitations

Document important technical, organizational, and legal limits that affect compliance or interpretation.

## 9. Future Considerations

Identify likely future updates, open problems, and planned extensions without creating speculative obligations.

## Appendix A (Non-normative): Rationale

Explain the ethical/technical reasoning and tradeoffs.

## Appendix B (Non-normative): Failure Modes & Abuse Cases

List likely failure modes, misuse, and how requirements mitigate them.

## Change Log

Track major changes and migration notes.

# Ethical Axioms (Layer 0)

## Purpose & Scope

This document defines a small, durable set of ethical axioms that serve as the normative anchor for all AI and quantum computing (QC) standards in this corpus.

Each standard **MUST** map its normative requirements to one or more axioms in this document.

## A1 — Unity & Social Cohesion

Systems **MUST NOT** create or amplify structural division, discrimination, or inequity across protected or otherwise vulnerable groups.

## A2 — Human Dignity & Moral Agency

Systems **MUST** preserve human moral agency. Systems **MUST NOT** coerce, deceive, or undermine meaningful consent, and **MUST** respect the integrity of persons and communities.

## A3 — Justice, Due Process, and Remedy

Decisions made or supported by systems **MUST** be **auditable**, **explainable to affected parties at an appropriate level**, and **contestable** with a timely path to remedy.

## A4 — Truthfulness & Trustworthiness

Systems **MUST** be designed and operated for integrity, reliability, and truthful representation of capabilities, limitations, and uncertainty.

## A5 — Proportionality & Moderation

Capability deployment **MUST** be proportional to societal readiness and risk. When uncertainty is high and harms are severe, deployment **SHOULD** be delayed or constrained.

## A6 — Participation & Consultation

Governance **MUST** be participatory, transparent, and multi-stakeholder. Affected communities **SHOULD** have meaningful input into decisions that shape their exposure to risk.

## A7 — Stewardship (Societal & Environmental)

Systems **MUST** account for societal disruption and environmental impacts, including energy, materials, and downstream effects.

## Interpretation Rules

IR-1 (Normative Priority). These axioms are normative anchors. When a standard introduces requirements, it **MUST**:

- identify the axioms it supports, and
- explain how compliance evidence demonstrates those axioms in practice.

IR-2 (Tradeoffs). Where axioms appear to be in tension in a specific context, a standard **MUST** document:

- the tradeoff,
- the risk-tier implications, and
- the compensating controls used to preserve dignity, justice, and safety.

IR-3 (Stability). Changes to this document **SHOULD** be rare. Any change that materially alters the meaning or scope of an axiom **MUST** be treated as a MAJOR change to the corpus.

## Relationship to Technical Standards

- Technical standards define testable requirements and auditable evidence artifacts.
- Ethical axioms define the ethical objectives those requirements must advance.
- A technical requirement with no axiom mapping is incomplete and **MUST NOT** be adopted as normative.

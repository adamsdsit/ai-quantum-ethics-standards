## A2 — Human Dignity & Moral Agency

Systems **MUST** preserve human moral agency. Systems **MUST NOT** coerce, deceive, or undermine meaningful consent, and **MUST** respect the integrity of persons and communities.

## A3 — Justice, Due Process, and Remedy

Decisions made or supported by systems **MUST** be **auditable**, **explainable to affected parties at an appropriate level**, and **contestable** with a timely path to remedy.

## A4 — Truthfulness & Trustworthiness

Systems **MUST** be designed and operated for integrity, reliability, and truthful representation of capabilities, limitations, and uncertainty.

## A5 — Proportionality & Moderation

Capability deployment **MUST** be proportional to societal readiness and risk. When uncertainty is high and harms are severe, deployment **SHOULD** be delayed or constrained.

# Case Study: AI + QC in Targeting Support

## Scenario

An organization considers using AI decision support and QC optimization to allocate surveillance assets and prioritize targets.

## Proposed Tier

Tier 3 (critical / existential), due to rights risk, escalation potential, and dual-use.

## Applicable Standards

- Dual-use and security: `03_quantum_standards/national_security.md`
- Research limits / moratorium: `03_quantum_standards/research_limits.md`
- Optimization ethics: `03_quantum_standards/optimization_ethics.md`
- AI safety/accountability: `02_ai_standards/safety.md`, `02_ai_standards/accountability.md`
- Consultation: `01_governance/consultation_framework.md`
- Certification/audit: `05_audit_and_assurance/*`

## Key Risks

- coercive or rights-violating targeting enabled by optimization objectives
- reduced human agency through procedural automation
- uncontrolled diffusion of dual-use capability

## Required Evidence Artifacts (Examples)

- explicit prohibited-use guardrails and enforcement controls
- governance decision memos and dual-use classification
- moratorium trigger criteria and pause authority proof

## Applicable Standards

- Transparency: `02_ai_standards/transparency_and_explainability.md`
- Fairness: `02_ai_standards/fairness.md`
- Safety: `02_ai_standards/safety.md`
- Accountability: `02_ai_standards/accountability.md`
- Consultation: `01_governance/consultation_framework.md`
- Audit: `05_audit_and_assurance/audit_methods.md`

## Key Risks

- disparate impact across demographic groups
- automation bias affecting clinician judgment
- unsafe recommendations under distribution shift

## Required Evidence Artifacts (Examples)

- disclosure packet and clinician-facing explanation design
- equity impact assessment with monitoring thresholds
- red-team report (clinical misuse + adversarial inputs)

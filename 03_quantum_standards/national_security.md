# Quantum Standard: Dual-Use and National Security Considerations

## 1. Purpose

Reduce the risk that quantum capabilities (or quantum-enhanced AI) are deployed in ways that destabilize security, enable rights-violating surveillance, or create uncontrolled escalation dynamics.

## 2. Applicability

- Applies to Tier 2–3 QC deployments and any QC work with credible dual-use risk.

## 3. Ethical Mapping

- `A5 Proportionality & Moderation`
- `A3 Justice, Due Process, and Remedy`
- `A6 Participation & Consultation`

## 4. Requirements (Normative)

Q-N-1 (Dual-Use Classification). Tier 2–3 programs **MUST** maintain a dual-use classification for:

- capability category
- misuse pathways
- potential severity and reversibility
- exposure and access model

Q-N-2 (Escalation Review). For Tier 3, dual-use classifications **MUST** trigger a governance review that includes:

- independent security assessment (internal or external)
- human rights impact review
- release constraint options (access controls, staged release, non-release)

Q-N-3 (Cross-Border Risk Considerations). Where systems operate across jurisdictions, operators **MUST** document:

- applicable legal constraints and conflict-of-law risks
- data transfer and sovereignty impacts
- safeguards preventing unlawful or rights-violating use

Q-N-4 (Non-Weaponization Guardrails). Where credible risk exists that QC capability materially enables rights-violating targeting or coercive surveillance, operators **MUST** implement guardrails and access controls sufficient to prevent such uses, or **MUST** refrain from deployment.

## 5. Compliance Evidence

- dual-use classification records and updates
- governance review minutes and decision memos
- cross-border risk assessments and mitigations
- access controls, monitoring, and enforcement logs

## 6. Rationale (Non-normative)

National security contexts produce strong incentives for secrecy and speed. This standard requires explicit reasoning, governance triggers, and guardrails to preserve human rights and systemic stability.

## 7. Failure Modes & Abuse Cases

- “silent deployment” without dual-use review
- expanding access models beyond original intent
- laundering coercive uses through proxies or third parties

## 8. Change Log

- v0.1: Initial draft.

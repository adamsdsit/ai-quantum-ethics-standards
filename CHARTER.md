# Charter for Ethical AI and Quantum Computing Standards

## Purpose

This initiative develops and maintains a living corpus of standards for AI and quantum computing (QC) that are globally applicable, regulator-ready, and grounded in human dignity, justice, unity, safety, and responsible scientific advancement.

## Why This Exists

AI and QC can produce extraordinary benefits, and also enable concentrated power, irreversible harm, and dual-use misuse. A credible standards effort must therefore:

- translate ethical commitments into testable requirements,
- specify evidence that can be audited, and
- provide governance mechanisms that are participatory and trustworthy.

## Values and Commitments

We commit to:

- **Human dignity and agency**: people remain the moral and legal subjects of decisions affecting them.
- **Justice and remedy**: affected parties can understand, contest, and obtain correction for harmful decisions.
- **Truthfulness and transparency**: claims about capability, risk, and compliance are accurate and verifiable.
- **Safety and stewardship**: systems are developed and operated with proportionality to risk and with attention to societal and environmental impacts.
- **Consultative governance**: decision-making is multi-stakeholder, transparent, and accountable.

## Scope of Ambition

This corpus provides:

- an ethical foundation (`00_foundations/ethical_axioms.md`),
- a risk framework (`04_risk_framework/*`),
- technical standards for AI and QC (`02_ai_standards/*`, `03_quantum_standards/*`),
- audit and assurance mechanisms (`05_audit_and_assurance/*`),
- case studies to stress-test applicability (`06_case_studies/*`).

## Governance Philosophy

The corpus is:

- **living**: improved over time as evidence and practice evolve,
- **traceable**: every requirement maps to axioms and evidence (`ETHICAL_TRACEABILITY.md`),
- **disciplined**: changes follow transparent rules (`VERSIONING.md`, `01_governance/governance_model.md`).

## Relationship to Existing Institutions

This initiative is intended to be interoperable with existing frameworks and standards bodies. It seeks alignment and practical adoption, not competition or “replacement.”

## Public Trust

We welcome critique, diverse participation, and independent review. We treat transparency, auditability, and the ability to pause high-risk deployment as conditions of legitimacy.

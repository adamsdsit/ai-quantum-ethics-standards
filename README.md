# AI + Quantum Ethics & Standards (Living Corpus)

This repository is a **living, values-grounded standards framework** spanning **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Quantum Computing (QC)**. It is designed to be **globally applicable**, **technically enforceable**, and **continuously improvable** via open review and versioned changes.

## Mission

To establish globally applicable, ethically grounded, and technically enforceable standards for AI and QC that advance **human dignity**, **justice**, **unity**, and the responsible use of scientific power for the betterment of humanity.

## How This Corpus Is Organized

Standards are organized as a stack:

1. **Ethical Axioms (Why)** — the normative anchor
2. **Governance (Who/How)** — decision-making and change control
3. **Technical Standards (What)** — requirements per domain
4. **Operational Controls (How enforced)** — procedures, monitoring, tooling
5. **Audit & Assurance (How proven)** — evidence, metrics, certification

## Normative Keywords

This corpus uses the normative terms **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** as described in RFC 2119 (and clarified by RFC 8174). See `00_foundations/definitions.md`.

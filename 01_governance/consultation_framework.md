# Consultation Framework

## Purpose

Specify minimum requirements for participatory governance, especially for Tier 2–3 systems where harms can be widespread or irreversible.

## Ethical Mapping

- `A6 Participation & Consultation`
- `A3 Justice, Due Process, and Remedy`

## Requirements (Normative)

CF-1. For Tier 2–3 deployments, operators **MUST** conduct structured consultation with:

- domain experts (technical + social impact)
- affected parties or their legitimate representatives
- regulators or relevant public-interest bodies (where applicable)

CF-2. Consultation **MUST** occur early enough to materially shape system design, not only after deployment decisions are finalized.

CF-3. Consultation records **MUST** include:

- who was consulted (roles, not necessarily identities)
- what risks/benefits were presented
- questions raised and responses
- decisions made and reasoning
- unresolved concerns and mitigation plan

CF-4. When consultation inputs are not adopted, the decision owner **MUST** document the rationale and compensating controls.

CF-5. Consultation materials **SHOULD** be published, redacting only what is necessary for privacy, safety, or legal constraints.

## Compliance Evidence

- consultation plan and timeline
- agendas, minutes, and synthesized feedback report
- decision memo linking feedback to design/control changes
- publication/redaction log

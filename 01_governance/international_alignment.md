# International Alignment (Working Notes)

## Purpose

Keep the corpus legible to regulators and standards bodies by maintaining crosswalks to widely recognized frameworks.

## Ethical Mapping

- `A4 Trustworthiness`: clarity and interoperability
- `A6 Participation`: alignment supports multi-jurisdiction adoption

## Approach

This document is intentionally non-normative. It tracks:

- which external frameworks a given standard resembles
- where this corpus introduces novel requirements (e.g., “right to non-inference”)
- potential conflicts and how to resolve them

## Crosswalk Placeholders

Maintain a table (to be filled) mapping:

- `02_ai_standards/*` ↔ NIST AI RMF functions/categories
- governance and risk tiers ↔ common regulatory tiering patterns
- `03_quantum_standards/*` ↔ post-quantum transition and dual-use guidance themes

## Novel Concepts to Track

- Explainability debt (operationally measurable)
- Right to non-inference (privacy/control beyond data access)
- Moratorium-capable governance (Tier 3 trigger conditions)

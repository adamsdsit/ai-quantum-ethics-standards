description: "How to navigate and apply the AI + Quantum ethics standards corpus."
---

This site presents the repository as a navigable standards corpus.

## Repository

The canonical source of truth is the Git repository:

- [GitHub: `adamsdsit/ai-quantum-ethics-standards`](https://github.com/adamsdsit/ai-quantum-ethics-standards)

Use GitHub Issues for gaps/ambiguities and Pull Requests for proposed changes.

## Quick Start

1. Read the **Charter** and **Ethical Axioms** to understand intent and non-negotiables.
2. Classify your system using the **Risk Classification** (Tier 0–3).
3. Use the **Control Matrix** to select applicable standards.
4. Implement controls and build an evidence package for audit/certification.

## Where to Start

- Foundations: `00_foundations/ethical_axioms`
- Risk tiering: `04_risk_framework/risk_classification`
- Control selection: `04_risk_framework/control_matrix`
- Traceability: `meta/ETHICAL_TRACEABILITY`
- Versioning: `meta/VERSIONING`

## Visual Flow
